The project was created in the second year at Coventry University for 216CR module lead by Chris Peters.
The goal of this project was to crate a graphical user interface using TKinter and connect to a database (in memory or on-line data base) using a python compatible sql library.

For the databases I have decided to use "pymysql" and connect to an on-line database where I store the results from all the games .

Check the Downloads tab for the documentation of the project and the Source tab if you want to have a quick look at the source code.
